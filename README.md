## Point

- We use `Airtable` as a `DataBase`, we didn't use django database (sqlite3) at all.
- Our service communicate with Airtable using `REST API`.
- We cannot finished one feature ( = write comment)',

    One exchange of parameter from html to views.py has a minor trouble. So we struggled to solve the problem, but it was failed.
